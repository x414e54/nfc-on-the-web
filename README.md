Web sites would benefit from being able to use NFC or PCSC based communications with a device such as a Smartphone or a Smartcard. This would allow actions such as logging in to a website or paying for goods online, or reading tags. Also the functionality could allow web pages to use onboard NFC reader of a SmartPhone, allowing for more richer HTML based "applications" and closing the gap between Native and Web.

The intention would be to design a JavaScript API for implementing PCSC compatible transactions and NFC. A browser extension/plugin would be made, or a custom compile of an open source browser, to convert this JavaScript API and use native calls to be able to use an attached or built in NFC/PCSC device.

A sample application such as an NFC based login system, or payment system will be created.
